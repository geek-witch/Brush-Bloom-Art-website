            bio: "Contemporary sculptor working with bronze and found objects to create pieces that explore music, rhythm, and harmony.",
            fullBio: "David Miller is a contemporary sculptor whose work explores the themes of music, rhythm, and harmony through three-dimensional form. Working primarily with bronze and found objects, David creates sculptures that capture the essence of musical expression and movement. His background as a professional musician informs his artistic practice, allowing him to translate auditory experiences into visual and tactile forms. Based in Austin, Texas, David's sculptures range from intimate tabletop pieces to large-scale public installations. His work has been commissioned for concert halls, music schools, and public spaces throughout the United States. David is particularly interested in how sculpture can evoke sensory experiences beyond the visual, creating pieces that seem to resonate with silent music. His innovative approach to materials and form has earned him recognition in both the art and music communities.",
